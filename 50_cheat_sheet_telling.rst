     - Story
     - Action
   * - 1
     - Once upon a time, this **ship** sailed the seven seas.
     - *Present the paper boat. Let it “sail” in the air.*
   * - 2
     - But then one night, the sea got very rough, and a violent **thunderstorm** with waves as high as houses wrecked the ship. The **bow** crashed.
     - *Tear off one end of the paper boat. Tear from halfway along the upper deck to the lower corner of the boat.*
   * - 3
     - The **stern** got smashed.
     - *Tear off the other end of the paper boat in the same way.*
   * - 4
     - The **mast** broke.
     - *Tear off the top corner of the paper boat. Tear it off in a circular motion as it will become the neckline of the captain’s shirt later.*
   * - 5
     - The ship, with all its freight, gold and silver, was **buried in the sea** and was never seen again.
     - *Demonstrate with the paper boat how the wrecked ship sinks.*
   * - 6
     - Only one item **was found** at the beach, years later. It was **the captain’s shirt**—the last shirt the captain ever wore.
     - *Unfold the wrecked paper boat and present the shirt.*
   * - 7
     - And how do we know that it was **summer** when the ship sank? Because if it had been **winter**, the captain would have worn—a **sweater**!
     - *Fully unfold the paper, turn it around, and fold the paper back in half so that it has long sleeves now. — Present the sweater.*
