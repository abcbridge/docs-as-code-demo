Hallo Webinar :)
====================

With a paper hat, you are ready to fold a paper boat. Or have a hat party!

**Prerequisite:** To fold a paper hat, you will need a sheet of paper. For best results, use a :index:`rectangular` sheet of paper. Standard letter format or DIN A4 format works just fine.



1. Put your paper in portrait orientation and fold the paper in half, top to bottom. (Fold is parallel to short edges.)

2. To find the centre, fold sidewards in half and unfold.
