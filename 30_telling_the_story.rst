Telling the story of the captain's shirt :) :) :) :) 
===========================================

Fascinate your audience with a simple yet engaging story.

**Prerequisite:** To tell the story, you will need a :ref:`paper boat<chapter-boat>`.

.. note::

   The following steps only describe the essential story elements. Be :index:`creative` and **embellish the story** as much as you like.

.. index:: captain, ship, seven seas

1. Tell your audience how once upon a time, a captain was sailing the seven seas on this ship.

   *Meanwhile, show the paper boat to your audience and move it as if it were navigating.*

.. index:: thunderstorm

2. Tell your audience that one night the sea got very rough, and a violent thunderstorm with waves as high as houses wrecked the ship. At first, the :term:`bow` crashed.
   
   *Tear off one end of the paper boat. Tear from halfway along the upper deck to the lower corner of the boat.*

3. Next, the :term:`stern` was smashed.
   
   *Tear off the other end of the paper boat in the same way.*

4. Finally, the :term:`mast` broke.
   
   *Tear off the top corner of the paper boat. Tear it off in a circular motion as it will become the neckline of the captain’s shirt later.*

5. Tell your audience how the ship, with all its freight, gold and silver, was buried in the sea and was never seen again. 

   *Demonstrate with the paper boat how the wrecked ship sinks.*

.. index:: shirt

6. Tell your audience that only one item was found at the beach, years later. It was the captain’s shirt—the last shirt the captain ever wore.

   *Unfold the wrecked paper boat and present the shirt.*

.. index:: sweater

7. Ask your audience: And how do we know that it was summer when the ship sank? 
   
   Wait for a moment to create some tension.

   *Meanwhile, fully unfold the paper, turn it around, and fold the paper back in half so that it has long sleeves now.*

   Now, solve the riddle: Because if it had been winter, the captain would have worn—**a sweater!**

   *Present the sweater.*
