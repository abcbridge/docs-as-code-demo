Acknowledgements:

   With thanks to peers, family, and friends for their ongoing support. 

   Special thanks to my sister-in-law Claudia. I had the pleasure of watching her perform the paper boat story to a group of hungry and impatient kids in a restaurant. The Captain's shirt calmed them down and kept them occupied until the food arrived.

All content in this resource was created by myself, Anita Lüders.
